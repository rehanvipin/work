# So much to learn 😮
I think I should learn these things because they might be useful at work:

* Common design patterns (with examples?)
* Should add a lifecycle section to Angular? Maybe just link to the [docs?](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks)
* Add more content about Angular services (really needed?)
* TypeScript, since it's the default lang for Angular. [Just an overview from a YT video perhaps?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCg4U1FzODs)
* Search for "TODO" in the Angular notes and do those parts
* For the Angular docs do it in this order: "Getting Started" -> "Tutorials" -> "Understanding Angular" -> "Reference/Conceptual Reference"
* ngModel is one fancy thing. [Check out the docs](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgModel) to understand it.

No rush, gonna add things whenever I feel the need to (I believe that is the best way for me to learn) 🍃.
