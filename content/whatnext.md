# So much to learn
These sound useful:

## What to learn next
* Search for "TODO" in notes and do those parts
* Angular has its own "learn next" [page](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-next-steps) in which
"schematics" seems to be something cool.
* RxJS and Angular Signals from this [course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/rxjs-angular-signals-fundamentals/table-of-contents)
* The ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError. Couple of articles [one](https://angularindepth.com/posts/1001/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-expressionchangedafterithasbeencheckederror-error) and [two](https://angularindepth.com/posts/1514/deep-dive-into-the-infamous-expressionchangedafterithasbeencheckederror-in-angular)
* About change detection in Angular. [one](https://angularindepth.com/posts/1512/change-detection-and-component-trees-in-angular-applications) and [two](https://angularindepth.com/posts/1509/overview-of-angulars-change-detection-operations-in-ivy)
* Angular router - <https://blog.angular-university.io/angular2-router/>
* What really is ngModule - <https://blog.angular-university.io/angular2-ngmodule/>


## Low Priority - Design
* Get an overview of what design is about [from this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBUJYEQ7OGY).
* Learn how to use penpot [with their YT tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpINco5nWw4&list=PLgcCPfOv5v57cJS0im5FYFwbsu6X5mkNq). [This walkthrough can give a good idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUg3xIFWK_g).
* Note down points from [Brad's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o) [Walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o) and [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYFwcIRx16g) [Kevin's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhLMEdiKuMg).
* Writing documentation. It's useful because that's what people see first and that's how they can contribute
and use what you're building. [Some points from here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-good-documentation/) and [this place which shows you how to start](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/). There are also [principles to follow](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/docs-principles/).
* Common design patterns [from a good fcc article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-design-patterns-explained/)
* [Good article on testing.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-tutorial-how-to-test-javascript-and-reactjs-app/) This covers TDD and stuff
