# So much to learn
These sound useful:

## WebDev stuff
* Search for "TODO" in notes and do those parts
* What really is ngModule - <https://blog.angular-university.io/angular2-ngmodule/>
* How do service workers work? [Service Workies](https://serviceworkies.com/)
* [Good article on testing.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-tutorial-how-to-test-javascript-and-reactjs-app/) This covers TDD and stuff
* [Asynchronous programming in JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Concepts)
used by all modern applications.
* [Client side web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs) 
tells how to use JS for your page. Pre-requisite for JS frameworks (I think).
* [Event Loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop)
is how JS is executed in the browser. This seems important to know how JS actually executes.
* [Arrays for binary data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) 
is how you deal with raw data. Sounds fun!  
* [Execution contexts in JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/execution-context-how-javascript-works-behind-the-scenes) 
explains how the browser engine processes your scripts.
* Practise here : https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges

## Java
* jvm section
* modules section
* web server section
* spring boot section - there's a LOT here

## SRE principles
I would like to ensure that systems run reliabily and handle errors gracefully.
* [Google - Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/)
* [Google - Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/)
* [Google - Site Reliability Engineering](https://sre.google/sre-book/simplicity/)

## Work on some projects
* Good Karma file reporter. The existing ones aren't that great.
* Contribute to Firefox to keep it alive.
* Contribute to OpenMined : <https://blog.openmined.org/>

## Complete some challenges
* [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/)
* [Hackattic](https://hackattic.com/)

## Finish certification courses
* [Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/home/week/3)
* [Secure and Private AI](https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud185)
* [Game Theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-theory-1/home/welcome)

## Communication
Getting better at communication
* [Guide to Internal Communication, the Basecamp Way](https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate)
* [Effective communication is not about what you say](https://github.com/readme/guides/effective-communication)
* Writing documentation. It's useful because that's what people see first and that's how they can contribute
and use what you're building. [Some points from here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-good-documentation/) and [this place which shows you how to start](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/beginners-guide-to-docs/). There are also [principles to follow](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/docs-principles/).

## Low Priority - Design
* Get an overview of what design is about [from this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBUJYEQ7OGY).
* Learn how to use penpot [with their YT tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpINco5nWw4&list=PLgcCPfOv5v57cJS0im5FYFwbsu6X5mkNq). [This walkthrough can give a good idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUg3xIFWK_g).
* Note down points from [Brad's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsEnj-1hG2o) [Walkthroughs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o) and [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYFwcIRx16g) [Kevin's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhLMEdiKuMg).
