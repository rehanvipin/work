# Signals
To make Angular apps more responsive.
The different parts are : 
* Observing certain changes
* Listening to notifications about the changes
* Reacting accordingly

Signals can be thought of as a combination of state and a notification mechanism.

How is that different from RxJS observables?
They are a notification mechanism for *events* and don't really hold state.
